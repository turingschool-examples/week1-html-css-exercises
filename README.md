## Week 1 Review

### The Game Plan
The following exercises will help to build up some muscle memory on the vocabulary and syntax we have talked about this week. Now is the time to start applying what we talk about in class to independent projects.   

As always, we will throw in some curveballs that we haven't talked about yet. Take a second to experiment with some possible solutions before you google. If they don't work - thats ok! Learning a new language is as much about errors as it is about getting things right.

### Rules
1. Complete each mini challenge.
  * You are welcome to use [codepen](http://www.codepen.io) for this, although you are strongly encouraged to create a directory on your computer and start getting used to building things in Atom instead.
  * An additional benefit of using Atom is that you'll have some examples to reference for the rest of the mod locally on your computer.  


2. GET AS FAR AS YOU CAN BEFORE GOOGLING.  

  The following should be your plan of attack for the rest of this mod:
  * **Start completely from memory**. When you reach a road block and you don't know what to type next, take a solid minute to stop and just THINK about the challenge before asking google/your neighbor/your notebook for an answer. Your brain absorbs more than you think it does!  
  - Once you really can't remember, **check your notebook first**. You should be taking hand-written notes as much as you can. Before you can build muscle memory, your brain needs to understand what the goal is. Studies show that using a pen and paper slows down the thought process to solidify new information more than taking notes on a computer does.
  - If you didn't take handwritten notes, **try the interwebs**. There's a pretty solid chance someone on StackOverflow has asked the same question you have.
  - If google fails you, or the search results are unclear, **ask your neighbor**! Then ask your other neighbor! Then ping your channel in slack!
  - **Ask Robbie**.

#### IDs and Classes

* You can use english rainbow colors here( `red`, `orange`, `green`..etc)- or feel free to get weird with it.
